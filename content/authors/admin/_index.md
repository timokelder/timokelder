Timo Kelder is a PhD student in climate science at Loughborough University, with visiting status at Oxford University and ECMWF. Supervised by Prof. Rob Wilby, Dr Tim Marjoribanks, Dr Louise Slater and Prof. Christel Prudhomme, he analyses large-ensemble climate model simulations to quantify climate extremes and explain their non-stationary behaviour beyond what is possible from observed records (UNSEEN). As part of an MSc in Earth and Environment at Wageningen University, Timo held an internship at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MetNor). As hydrologist within the project `Translating Weather Extremes into the Futureâ€™ at MetNor, he was part of an integral team to tackle high-impact flood events in Norway.
