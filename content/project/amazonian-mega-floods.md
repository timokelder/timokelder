summary: 'Extreme floods are typically analyzed by fitting statistical models to observed extremes. Most commonly, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is fitted to observed extremes, where extremes are defined as the maximum value within a `blockâ€™, i.e. within a certain time period such as a year or season. This method assumes that there is a uniform distribution driving the extremes, which does not always hold.

An alternative method is to utilize a large ensemble climate model. The many plausible realizations of reality simulated by the model can provide insight into potential present day (and future) extreme floods. Recently, a large ensemble streamflow dataset has been produced, and the amazon stands out for its characteristics that prevent extrapolation of observed extreme floods (der Wiel et al., 2019). It has been suggested that the co-occurrence of heavy precipitation events on different sub-catchments of the river can generate elevated river flows, and only large-ensemble climate simulations seem to be able to provide large enough samples for reliable quantification of extreme floods ([der Wiel et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL081967)). However, an understanding of the processes driving the simulated mega-floods and a critical assessment of their realism is thus far lacking. Here, we propose to EXplain Processes in Large-ensembles not constrainable in Observed REcords (EXPLORE), and use the large streamflow ensemble to 1) explain the drivers of the simulated mega-floods and 2) put them into perspective with historical events.'

What are the drivers of mega-floods in the Amazon?
