title: The role of spatial and temporal model resolution in a flood event storyline
  approach in Western Norway
author: ''
date: '2020-05-03'
abstract: 'A physical climate storyline approach is applied to an autumn flood event
  caused by an atmospheric river in the West Coast of Norway. The aim is to demonstrate
  the value and challenges of higher spatial and temporal resolution in simulating
  impacts. The modelling chain used is the same as the one used operationally, to
  issue flood warnings for example. Its output is therefore familiar to many users,
  which we expect will facilitate stakeholder engagement. Two different versions of
  a hydrological model are run to show that on the one hand, the higher spatial resolution
  between the global and regional model is necessary to realistically simulate the
  high spatial variability of precipitation in such a mountainous region. On the other
  hand we also show that the intensity of the peak streamflow is only captured realistically
  with hourly data. The higher resolution regional atmospheric model is able to simulate
  the fact that with the passage of an atmospheric river, some valleys receive high
  amounts of precipitation and others not. However, the coarser resolution global
  model shows uniform precipitation in the whole region. Translating the event into
  the future leads to similar results: while in some catchments, a future flood might
  be 50% larger than a present one, in others no event occurs because the atmospheric
  river does not hit that catchment.'
