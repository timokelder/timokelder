title: "UNSEEN trends: Towards detection of changes in 100-year precipitation
  events over the last 35 years"
abstract: Constraining the non-stationarity of climate extremes is a topical
  area of research that is complicated by the brevity and sparsity of
  observational records. For regions with available data, analyses typically
  focus on detecting century-long changes in the annual maxima. However, these
  are not necessarily impact-relevant events and hence, a potentially more
  pressing research challenge is the detection of changes in the 1-in-100-year
  event. Furthermore, recent decades have seen abrupt temperature increases and
  therefore detecting decadal, rather than centurial, trends may be more
  important. An alternative approach to the traditional analysis based on
  observations is to pool ensemble members from seasonal prediction systems into
  an UNprecedented Simulated Extreme ENsemble (UNSEEN). This method creates
  numerous alternative pathways of reality, thus increasing the sample size.
  Previous studies have shown promising results that improve design value
  estimates by this method. Here, we use the hindcast of the ECMWF seasonal
  prediction system SEAS5 and pool together four lead times and 25 ensemble
  members, resulting in an ensemble of 100. We assess the robustness of this
  method in terms of the ensemble member independence, model stability and
  fidelity and then use the UNSEEN ensemble to detect non-stationarities in
  100-year precipitation estimates over the period 1981-2016. We justify the
  pooling of ensemble members and lead times through a case study of autumn
  3-day extreme precipitation events across Norway and Svalbard, which shows
  that the ensemble members are independent and that the model is stable over
  lead times. Despite previously reported model biases in the sea-ice extent and
  the sea-surface temperature in SEAS5, validation measures indicate that the
  model reliably reproduces ‘visible extremes’, i.e. the seasonal maxima. Using
  extreme value statistics, we then compare estimated return values from
  observations with the UNSEEN ensemble. Results indicate that the UNSEEN
  approach provides significantly different extreme values for return periods
  above 35 years. Additionally, while it is problematic to detect trends in the
  100-year values from observations, the UNSEEN approach finds a significant
  positive trend over Svalbard. Validating UNSEEN events and trends is a complex
  task, but our approach reproduces ‘visible’ extremes well, building confidence
  in the modeled extremes. Both Norway and Svalbard have experienced severe
  floods from extreme precipitation events and our UNSEEN-trends approach is the
  first to provide an indication of the changes in these rare events. Further
  application of this approach can 1) help estimating design values, especially
  relevant for data-scarce regions 2) detect trends in rare climate extremes,
  including other variables than precipitation and 3) improve our physical
  understanding of the non-stationarity of climate extremes, through the
  possible attribution of detected trends.
