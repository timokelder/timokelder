Hi! :wave: 

My work focusses on understanding the risk, trends and drivers of climate and weather extremes.:umbrella:

Large ensemble simulations are a great asset for furthering our understanding of extreme events, and I am convinced open science and reproducible workflows will help us analyse and understand the big data sources that exist! :bowtie:
