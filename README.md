Hi! :wave: 

My work focusses on understanding the risk, trends and drivers of climate and weather extremes.:umbrella:
A great asset for this is large ensemble simulations, and I am convinced open science and reproducible (at least transparent) workflows will help us analyse and understand the big data sources that exist! :bowtie:

Current projects:
